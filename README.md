# Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Classification
Pima Indians Diabetes Classification using various supervised algorithms with feature importance

## About The Project
* This project focuses on the binary classification task of predicting diabetes in Pima Indian tribe individuals based on various health-related features. We employ a range of supervised machine-learning algorithms to create predictive models.

* Algorithms used in this project:
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Decision Tree
  * K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  * Logistic Regression
  * Naive Bayes
  * Artificial Neural Networks (4 hidden layer, with 256 nodes for each layer, and 'ReLU' as the activation function)
  * Random Forest
  * Ensemble Methods

* There are 2 experiments, which differ in the preprocessing stage:
  1. Scaling the data using StandardScaler (modify data distribution to match **standard normal distribution**, with mean 0, and standard deviation 1)
  2. Without scaling the data

* Experiment with scaling the data get better performance in most of the algorithms

## Technology Used
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* vecstack

## Dataset
This project uses a dataset provided by the University of California, Irvine on their Machine Learning Repository. We use a specific dataset on diabetes, which is [Pima Indians Diabetes Database - UCI Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
